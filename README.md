# the fish 🐟
My WIP Personal multi-purpose Discord bot built in Rust.

Mainly for programming practice, but also to attempt to code a bunch of niche random tasks that I think could be useful in a discord bot.
## Features
- Ping command with time (ms) between command and bot's response
- Performance Point calculator for osu!standard beatmap links
- You can say hi to the fish :)
